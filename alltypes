            performs transactions for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added
            to the sum.  For example, a node which performs only
            routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)).
            In contrast, a node which is a host offering application
            services would have a value of 72 (2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)).
            Note that in the context of the Internet suite of
            protocols, values should be calculated accordingly:

                 layer      functionality

  DESCRIPTION	"The media-dependent `physical' address.

            Setting this object to a null string (one of zero

            corresponding entry in the atTable object.  That
            is, it effectively dissasociates the interface
            identified with said entry from the mapping
            identified with said entry.  It is an
            implementation-specific matter as to whether the
            agent removes an invalidated entry from the table.
            Accordingly, management stations must be prepared
            to receive tabular information from agents that
            corresponds to entries not currently in use.

            In order to use this lock to coordinate the use of set

            While this table is writable, the user will note that
            several objects, such as ipAddressOrigin, are not.  The
            intention in allowing a user to write to this table is to
            allow them to add or remove any entry that isn't

            permanent.  The user should be allowed to modify objects
            and entries when that would not cause inconsistencies
            within the table.  Allowing write access to objects, such
            as ipAddressOrigin, could allow a user to insert an entry
            and then label it incorrectly.

            Note well: When including IPv6 link-local addresses in this
            table, the entry must use an InetAddressType of 'ipv6z' in
            order to differentiate between the possible interfaces."

  DESCRIPTION	"The type of mapping.

            Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect
            of invalidating the corresponding entry in the

            associates the interface identified with said entry from the

            implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent

            removes an invalidated entry from the table.  Accordingly,
            management stations must be prepared to receive tabular
            information from agents that corresponds to entries not
            currently in use.  Proper interpretation of such entries
            requires examination of the relevant ipNetToPhysicalType
            object.

            The 'dynamic(3)' type indicates that the IP address to
            physical addresses mapping has been dynamically resolved
            using e.g., IPv4 ARP or the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
            protocol.

            The 'static(4)' type indicates that the mapping has been
            statically configured.  Both of these refer to entries that
            provide mappings for other entities addresses.

            The 'local(5)' type indicates that the mapping is provided
            for an entity's own interface address.

UDP-MIB::udpEndpointTable

  -- FROM	UDP-MIB

  STATUS	current
  DESCRIPTION	"A table containing information about this entity's UDP
            endpoints on which a local application is currently
            accepting or sending datagrams.

            The address type in this table represents the address
            type used for the communication, irrespective of the
            higher-layer abstraction.  For example, an application
            using IPv6 'sockets' to communicate via IPv4 between
            ::ffff:10.0.0.1 and ::ffff:10.0.0.2 would use
            InetAddressType ipv4(1).

            Unlike the udpTable in RFC 2013, this table also allows
            the representation of an application that completely
            specifies both local and remote addresses and ports.  A
            listening application is represented in three possible
            ways:

            1) An application that is willing to accept both IPv4
               and IPv6 datagrams is represented by a
               udpEndpointLocalAddressType of unknown(0) and a
               udpEndpointLocalAddress of ''h (a zero-length
               octet-string).

            2) An application that is willing to accept only IPv4
               or only IPv6 datagrams is represented by a
               udpEndpointLocalAddressType of the appropriate
               address type and a udpEndpointLocalAddress of
               '0.0.0.0' or '::' respectively.

            3) An application that is listening for datagrams only
               for a specific IP address but from any remote
               system is represented by a
               udpEndpointLocalAddressType of the appropriate
               address type, with udpEndpointLocalAddress
               specifying the local address.

            In all cases where the remote is a wildcard, the
            udpEndpointRemoteAddressType is unknown(0), the
            udpEndpointRemoteAddress is ''h (a zero-length
            octet-string), and the udpEndpointRemotePort is 0.

            If the operating system is demultiplexing UDP packets
            by remote address and port, or if the application has
            'connected' the socket specifying a default remote
            address and port, the udpEndpointRemote* values should
            be used to reflect this."

               or only IPv6 datagrams, the value of this object
               must be '0.0.0.0' or '::', respectively, while the

               udpEndpointLocalAddressType object represents the
               appropriate address type.

            3. For an application that is listening for data
               destined only to a specific IP address, the value
               of this object is the specific IP address for which
               this node is receiving packets, with the
               corresponding instance of the
               udpEndpointLocalAddressType object representing the
               appropriate address type.

            As this object is used in the index for the
            udpEndpointTable, implementors of this table should be
            careful not to create entries that would result in OIDs

                    This object contains an OBJECT IDENTIFIER
                    which identifies the chipset used to
                    realize the interface. Ethernet-like
                    interfaces are typically built out of
                    several different chips. The MIB implementor
                    is presented with a decision of which chip
                    to identify via this object. The implementor
                    should identify the chip which is usually
                    called the Medium Access Control chip.
                    If no such chip is easily identifiable,
                    the implementor should identify the chip
                    which actually gathers the transmit
                    and receive statistics and error
                    indications. This would allow a
                    manager station to correlate the
                    statistics and the chip generating
                    them, giving it the ability to take
                    into account any known anomalies
                    in the chip.

                    This object has been deprecated.  Implementation
                    feedback indicates that it is of limited use for
                    debugging network problems in the field, and
                    the administrative overhead involved in
                    maintaining a registry of chipset OIDs is not
                    justified."

                    entity.  'unknown' indicates that the current

                    Management control of the duplex mode is
                    accomplished through the MAU MIB.  When
                    an interface does not support autonegotiation,
                    or when autonegotiation is not enabled, the
                    duplex mode is controlled using
                    ifMauDefaultType.  When autonegotiation is
                    supported and enabled, duplex mode is controlled

                    determine the duplex status of an interface
                    without having to know every possible value of
                    ifMauType.  This was felt to be sufficiently

                    10Base5 and 10Base2.  The TDR value may be
                    useful in determining the approximate distance

                    this test to check for a consistent resulting
                    TDR value, to verify that there is a fault.

                    A TDR test returns as its result the time
                    interval, measured in 10 MHz ticks or 100 nsec

  DESCRIPTION	"******** THIS IDENTITY IS DEPRECATED *******

                    This test configures the MAC chip and executes
                    an internal loopback test of memory, data paths,
                    and the MAC chip logic.  This loopback test can
                    only be executed if the interface is offline.
                    Once the test has completed, the MAC chip should

                    be reinitialized for network operation, but it
                    should remain offline.

                    If an error occurs during a test, the
                    appropriate test result object will be set

        Interval.  These values are used to calculate the Utilization

  MAX-ACCESS	read-only
  STATUS	current
  DESCRIPTION	"The best estimate of the total number of collisions
        on this Ethernet segment.

        The value returned will depend on the location of the
        RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section
        10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a
        station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if
        three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously.  A
        repeater port must detect a collision when two or more

        stations are transmitting simultaneously.  Thus a probe
        placed on a repeater port could record more collisions
        than a probe connected to a station on the same segment
        would.

        Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering
        10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3
        defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals
        on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving
        at the same time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
        collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes placed on
        a station and a repeater, should report the same number of
        collisions.

        Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should
        ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or
        more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE
        802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax
        segments to which the repeater is connected."

  DESCRIPTION	"The best estimate of the total number of collisions
        on this Ethernet segment during this sampling

        The value returned will depend on the location of the
        RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section
        10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a
        station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if
        three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously.  A
        repeater port must detect a collision when two or more

        stations are transmitting simultaneously.  Thus a probe
        placed on a repeater port could record more collisions
        than a probe connected to a station on the same segment
        would.

        Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering
        10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3
        defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals
        on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving
        at the same time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
        collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes placed on
        a station and a repeater, should report the same number of
        collisions.

        Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should
        ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or
        more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE
        802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax
        segments to which the repeater is connected."

  DESCRIPTION	"An index that uniquely identifies an entry in
        the hostTime table among those entries associated
        with the same hostControlEntry.  This index shall
        be between 1 and N, where N is the value of

        the associated hostControlTableSize.  The ordering
        of the indexes is based on the order of each entry's
        insertion into the table, in which entries added earlier
        have a lower index value than entries added later.
        Thus the management station has the ability to
        learn of new entries added to this table without
        downloading the entire table.

        It is important to note that the index for a
        particular entry may change as an (earlier) entry
        is deleted from the table.  Because this order may
        change, management stations should make use of the
        hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the
        hostControlEntry associated with the relevant
        portion of the hostTimeTable.  By observing
        this variable, the management station may detect
        the circumstances where a download of the table
        may have missed entries, and where a previous
        association between a value of hostTimeCreationOrder
        and a hostTimeEntry may no longer hold."

  DESCRIPTION	"The status that is to be matched with the input packet.
        The only bits relevant to this match algorithm are those that
        have the corresponding filterPktStatusMask bit equal to one.
        The following two rules are then applied to every packet:

        (1) For each relevant bit from the packet status with the
            corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to zero, if
            the bit from the packet status is not equal to the

            corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the
            packet will fail this status match.

        (2) If for every relevant bit from the packet status with the
            corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to one, the
            bit from the packet status is equal to the corresponding
            bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail
            this status match.

        Any packets that have not failed either of the two matches
        above have passed this status match.  In particular, a zero
        length status filter will match any packet's status.

        The value of the packet status is a sum.  This sum
        initially takes the value zero.  Then, for each
        error, E, that has been discovered in this packet,
        2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum.
        The errors and the bits that represent them are dependent
        on the media type of the interface that this channel
        is receiving packets from.

        The errors defined for a packet captured off of an
        Ethernet interface are as follows:

            bit #    Error
                0    Packet is longer than 1518 octets
                1    Packet is shorter than 64 octets
                2    Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error

        For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a
        value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2).

        As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object
        will have other media-specific errors defined.

        For the purposes of this status matching algorithm, if the
        packet status is longer than this filterPktStatus object,
        this object is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it
        reaches the size of the packet status.

        This object may not be modified if the associated
        filterStatus object is equal to valid(1)."

captureBufferPacketStatus OBJECT-TYPE

  SYNTAX	Integer32

  STATUS	current
  DESCRIPTION	"A value which indicates the error status of this packet.

        The value of this object is defined in the same way as
        filterPktStatus.  The value is a sum.  This sum
        initially takes the value zero.  Then, for each
        error, E, that has been discovered in this packet,
        2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum.

        The errors defined for a packet captured off of an
        Ethernet interface are as follows:

            bit #    Error
                0    Packet is longer than 1518 octets

                1    Packet is shorter than 64 octets
                2    Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error
                3    First packet in this capture buffer after
                     it was detected that some packets were
                     not processed correctly.
                4    Packet's order in buffer is only approximate
                     (May only be set for packets sent from
                     the probe)

        For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a
        value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2).

        As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object
        will have other media-specific errors defined."

  DESCRIPTION	"The (conceptual) table of logical storage areas on
        the host.

        An entry shall be placed in the storage table for each
        logical area of storage that is allocated and has
        fixed resource limits.  The amount of storage
        represented in an entity is the amount actually usable
        by the requesting entity, and excludes loss due to
        formatting or file system reference information.

        These entries are associated with logical storage
        areas, as might be seen by an application, rather than
        physical storage entities which are typically seen by
        an operating system.  Storage such as tapes and
        floppies without file systems on them are typically
        not allocated in chunks by the operating system to
        requesting applications, and therefore shouldn't
        appear in this table.  Examples of valid storage for
        this table include disk partitions, file systems, ram
        (for some architectures this is further segmented into
        regular memory, extended memory, and so on), backing
        store for virtual memory (`swap space').

        This table is intended to be a useful diagnostic for
        `out of memory' and `out of buffers' types of
        failures.  In addition, it can be a useful performance
        monitoring tool for tracking memory, disk, or buffer
        usage."

        Bits are numbered starting with the most significant
        bit of the first byte being bit 0, the least
        significant bit of the first byte being bit 7, the
        most significant bit of the second byte being bit 8,
        and so on.  A one bit encodes that the condition was
        detected, while a zero bit encodes that the condition
        was not detected.

            On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of

            associated with the same interface for as long as that

            write access to this object is required to keep the value in
            non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new

  DESCRIPTION	"This table contains one entry per interface.  It defines
            objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent
            to test an interface for various faults.  Tests for an
            interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that
            interface.  After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult
            can be read to determine the outcome.  If an agent can not
            perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate.  The
            object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test-
            specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific)
            information concerning the outcome of the test.  Only one
            test can be in progress on each interface at any one time.
            If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the
            second test is rejected.  Some agents may reject a test when
            a prior test is active on another interface.

            Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain
            'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the
            interface to be tested.  This is accomplished with the
            ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows:

          try_again:
              get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)

              /*
               * Is not being used right now -- let's compete
               * to see who gets it.

              if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse,
                       ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE)
                  /*
                   * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go
                   * try again
                   */
                  goto try_again;

              /*
               * I have the lock
               */
              set up any test parameters.

              /*
               * This starts the test
               */
              set(ifTestType = test_to_run);

              wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult

              when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult

              if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid

            A manager station first retrieves the value of the
            appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically
            repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of
            ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'.  The manager station then tries
            to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just
            retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the
            corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating
            itself.  If the set operation succeeds then the manager has
            obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the
            ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the
            semantics of TestAndIncr).  Failure of the set operation
            indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of
            the ifTestEntry.

            Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be
            setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType.
            On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to
            'notInUse'.  Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the
            results.  In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests
            by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be
            a possibility that the first test's results might be
            overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first

            results being read.  This unlikely circumstance ca"

  DESCRIPTION	"A control variable used to start and stop operator-

            assigned to tests are defined elsewhere, in association with
            specific types of interface.  However, this document assigns
            a value for a full-duplex loopback test, and defines the
            special meanings of the subject identifier:

                noTest  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 }

            When the value noTest is written to this object, no action
            is taken unless a test is in progress, in which case the
            test is aborted.  Writing any other value to this object is

            only valid when no test is currently in progress, in which
            case the indicated test is initiated.

            When read, this object always returns the most recent value
            that ifTestType was set to.  If it has not been set since
            the last initialization of the network management subsystem
            on the agent, a value of noTest is returned."

  DESCRIPTION	"The set of days in a month on which a scheduled action
         should take place.  There are two sets of bits one can
         use to define the day within a month:

         Enumerations starting with the letter 'd' indicate a
         day in a month relative to the first day of a month.
         The first day of the month can therefore be specified
         by setting the bit d1(0) and d31(30) means the last
         day of a month with 31 days.

         Enumerations starting with the letter 'r' indicate a
         day in a month in reverse order, relative to the last
         day of a month.  The last day in the month can therefore
         be specified by setting the bit r1(31) and r31(61) means
         the first day of a month with 31 days.

         Setting multiple bits will include several days in the set
         of possible days for this schedule.  Setting all bits will
         cause the scheduler to ignore the day within a month.

         Setting all bits starting with the letter 'd' or the
         letter 'r' will also cause the scheduler to ignore the
         day within a month.

         - `disabled' indicates that the script can not be used.

         - `editing' indicates that the script can be modified in the

         - `compiling' indicates that the script is currently being
           compiled by the runtime system.

         - `noSuchScript' indicates that the script does not exist
           at the smScriptSource.

         - `accessDenied' indicates that the script can not be loaded
           from the smScriptSource due to a lack of permissions.

         - `wrongLanguage' indicates that the script can not be
            loaded from the smScriptSource because of a language
            mismatch.

         - `wrongVersion' indicates that the script can not be loaded

         - `compilationFailed' indicates that the compilation failed.

         - `noResourcesLeft' indicates that the runtime system does
           not have enough resources to load the script.

         - `unknownProtocol' indicates that the script could not be
           loaded from the smScriptSource because the requested
           protocol is not supported.

         - `protocolFailure' indicates that the script could not be

         The storage type of this row always complies with the value

         However, the storage type of the script controlled by this
         row may be different, if the value of this entry is

         (a) the URL contained in the smScriptSource object is empty

         Setting this object to `volatile' removes a script from

         The value of smScriptStorageType is only meaningful if the

smLaunchStart OBJECT-TYPE
  -- FROM	DISMAN-SCRIPT-MIB

  MAX-ACCESS	read-create
  STATUS	current
  DESCRIPTION	"This object is used to start the execution of scripts.
         When retrieved, the value will be the value of smRunIndex
         for the last script that started execution by manipulating
         this object. The value will be zero if no script started
         execution yet.

         A script is started by setting this object to an unused
         smRunIndex value. A new row in the smRunTable will be
         created which is indexed by the value supplied by the
         set-request in addition to the value of smLaunchOwner and
         smLaunchName. An unused value can be obtained by reading
         the smLaunchRunIndexNext object.

         Setting this object to the special value 0 will start
         the script with a self-generated smRunIndex value. The
         consequence is that the script invoker has no reliable
         way to determine the smRunIndex value for this script
         invocation and that the invoker has therefore no way
         to obtain the results from this script invocation. The
         special value 0 is however useful for scheduled script
         invocations.

         If this object is set, the following checks must be

         performed:

         1) The value of the smLaunchOperStatus object in this
            entry of the smLaunchTable must be `enabled'.
         2) The values of smLaunchScriptOwner and
            smLaunchScriptName of this row must identify an
            existing entry in the smScriptTable.
         3) The value of smScriptOperStatus of this entry must
            be `enabled'.
         4) The principal performing the set operation must have
            read access to the script. This must be checked by
            calling the isAccessAllowed abstract service interface
            defined in RFC 2271 on the row in the smScriptTable
            identified by smLaunchScriptOwner and smLaunchScriptName.
            The isAccessAllowed abstract service interface must be
            called on all columnar objects in the smScriptTable with
            a MAX-ACCESS value different than `not-accessible'. The
            test fails as soon as a call indicates that access is
            not allowed.
         5) If the value provided by the set operation is not 0,
            a check must be made that the value is currently not
            in use. Otherwise, if the value provided by the set
            operation is 0, a suitable unused value must be
            generated.
         6) The number of currently executing scripts invoked
            from this smLaunchTable entry must be less than
            smLaunchMaxRunning.

         Attempts to start a script will fail with an
         inconsistentValue error if one of the checks described
         above fails.

         Otherwise, if all checks have been passed, a new entry
         in the smRunTable will be created indexed by smLaunchOwner,
         smLaunchName and the new value for smRunIndex. The value
         of smLaunchArgument will be copied into smRunArgument,
         the value of smLaunchLifeTime will be copied to
         smRunLifeTime, and the value of smLaunchExpireTime
         will be copied to smRunExpireTime.

         The smRunStartTime will be set to the current time and
         the smRunState will be set to `initializing' before the
         script execution is initiated in the appropriate runtime
         system.

         Note that the data type and the range of this object must
         be consistent with the smRunIndex object. Since this
         object might be written from the scheduling MIB, the

         data type Integer32 rather than Unsigned32 is used."

  DESCRIPTION	"This object specifies how long the script can execute.
         This object returns the remaining time that the script
         may run. The object is initialized with the value of the
         associated smLaunchLifeTime object and ticks backwards.
         The script is aborted immediately when the value reaches 0.

         The value of this object may be set in order to increase or
         reduce the remaining time that the script may run. Setting
         this value to 0 will abort script execution immediately,
         and, if the value of smRunExpireTime is also 0, will remove
         this entry from the smRunTable once it has terminated.

         If smRunLifeTime is set to its maximum value (2147483647),
         either by a set operation or by its initialization from the
         smLaunchLifeTime object, then it will not tick backwards.
         A running script with a maximum smRunLifeTime value will
         thus never be terminated with a `lifeTimeExceeded' exit
         code.

         The value of smRunLifeTime reflects the real-time execution
         time as seen by the outside world. The value of this object
         will always be 0 for a script that finished execution, that
         is smRunState has the value `terminated'.

         The value of smRunLifeTime does not change while a script
         is suspended, that is smRunState has the value `suspended'.
         Note that this does not affect set operations. It is legal
         to modify smRunLifeTime via set operations while a script
         is suspended."

  DESCRIPTION	"The status of the relationship between two sub-layers.

          An instance of this object exists for each instance of the
          ifStackStatus object, and vice versa.  For example, if the
          variable ifStackStatus.H.L exists, then the variable
          ifInvStackStatus.L.H must also exist, and vice versa.  In
          addition, the two variables always have the same value.

          However, unlike ifStackStatus, the ifInvStackStatus object
          is NOT write-able.  A network management application wishing
          to change a relationship between sub-layers H and L cannot
          do so by modifying the value of ifInvStackStatus.L.H, but
          must instead modify the value of ifStackStatus.H.L.  After
          the ifStackTable is modified, the change will be reflected

        For 'existence', the specific test is as selected by
        mteTriggerExistenceTest.  When an object appears, vanishes
        or changes value, the trigger fires. If the object's
        appearance caused the trigger firing, the object MUST
        vanish before the trigger can be fired again for it, and

        object's value, it will be fired again on every successive
        value change for that object.

        For 'boolean', the specific test is as selected by

        fires.  The trigger will not fire again until the value has

        discontinuity checking MUST still check sysUpTime for an overall
        discontinuity.

     It is an implementation-specific matter whether entries in this

     Note that keeping entries across initializations of the
     management system leads to some confusion with counters and
     TimeStamps, since both of those are based on sysUpTime, which
     resets on management initialization.  In this situation,
     counters apply only after the reset and nlmLogTime for entries
     made before the reset MUST be set to 0."

     Entries appear in this table when Notifications occur and pass

     the values of nlmConfigGlobalEntryLimit, nlmConfigGlobalAgeOut, or
     nlmConfigLogEntryLimit.

     If adding an entry would exceed nlmConfigGlobalEntryLimit or system
     resources in general, the oldest entry in any log SHOULD be removed
     to make room for the new one.

     If adding an entry would exceed nlmConfigLogEntryLimit the oldest
     entry in that log SHOULD be removed to make room for the new one.

     Before the managed system puts a locally-generated Notification
     into a non-null-named log it assures that the creator of the log
     has access to the information in the Notification.  If not it
     does not log that Notification in that log."

  DESCRIPTION	"The manager's Diffie-Hellman public value for this row.  Note
    that this value is not set via the SNMP agent, but may be set via
    some out of band method, such as the device's configuration file.

    The manager calculates this value in the same manner and using the
    same parameter set as the agent does.  E.g. it selects a random
    number 'r', calculates y = g^r mod p and provides 'y' as the
    public number expressed as an OCTET STRING.  See
    usmDHKickstartMyPublic for details.

    When this object is set with a valid value during initialization,
    a row is created in the usmUserTable with the following values:

    usmUserEngineID             localEngineID
    usmUserName                 [value of usmDHKickstartSecurityName]

    usmUserStorageType          permanent
    usmUserStatus               active

    A shared secret 'sk' is calculated at the agent as sk =
    mgrPublic^r mod p where r is the agents random number and p is the
    DH prime from the common parameters.  The underlying privacy key
    for this row is derived from sk by applying the key derivation
    function PBKDF2 defined in PKCS#5v2.0 with a salt of 0xd1310ba6,
    and iterationCount of 500, a keyLength of 16 (for
    usmDESPrivProtocol), and a prf (pseudo random function) of
    'id-hmacWithSHA1'.  The underlying authentication key for this row
    is derived from sk by applying the key derivation function PBKDF2
    with a salt of 0x98dfb5ac , an interation count of 500, a
    keyLength of 16 (for usmHMAC5AuthProtocol), and a prf of
    'id-hmacWithSHA1'.  Note: The salts are the first two words in the
    ks0 [key schedule 0] of the BLOWFISH cipher from 'Applied
    Cryptography' by Bruce Schnier - they could be any relatively
    random string of bits.

    The manager can use its knowledge of its own random number and the
    agent's public value to kickstart its access to the agent in a
    secure manner.  Note that the security of this approach is
    directly related to the strength of the authorization security of
    the out of band provisioning of the managers public value
    (e.g. the configuration file), but is not dependent at all on the
    strength of the confidentiality of the out of band provisioning
    data."

  DESCRIPTION	"This module defines MIB components for reading information
         from the accounting rules IP Firewall. This would typically
         let you read the rules and the counters. I did not include
         some flags and fields that I considered irrelevant for the
         accounting rules. Resetting the counters of the rules by SNMP
         would be simple, but I don't consider it so useful. I gave no
         consideration to implementing write access for allowing
         modification of the accounting rules.

  DESCRIPTION	"The bit mask which, in combination with the corresponding
         instance of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, defines a family of
         subtrees which are included in or excluded from the
         filter profile.

         Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a
         sub-identifier of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, with the
         most significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet
         string value (extended if necessary, see below)
         corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-th sub-identifier, and
         the least significant bit of the i-th octet of this
         octet string corresponding to the (8*i)-th
         sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through 16.

         Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not
         the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when
         determining if an OBJECT IDENTIFIER matches this
         family of filter subtrees; a '1' indicates that an
         exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild card',
         i.e., any sub-identifier value matches.

         Thus, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER X of an object instance
         is contained in a family of filter subtrees if, for
         each sub-identifier of the value of
         snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, either:

           the i-th bit of snmpNotifyFilterMask is 0, or

           the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to the i-th
           sub-identifier of the value of
           snmpNotifyFilterSubtree.

         If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and
         there are more than M sub-identifiers in the
         corresponding instance of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree,
         then the bit mask is extended with 1's to be the
         required length.

         Note that when the value of this object is the
         zero-length string, this extension rule results in
         a mask of all-1's being used (i.e., no 'wild card'),
         and the family of filter subtrees is the one
         subtree uniquely identified by the corresponding
         instance of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree."

  DESCRIPTION	"The table of users configured in the SNMP engine's
                 Local Configuration Datastore (LCD).

                 To create a new user (i.e., to instantiate a new
                 conceptual row in this table), it is recommended to
                 follow this procedure:

                   1)  GET(usmUserSpinLock.0) and save in sValue.

                   2)  SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue,
                           usmUserCloneFrom=templateUser,
                           usmUserStatus=createAndWait)
                       You should use a template user to clone from
                       which has the proper auth/priv protocol defined.

                 If the new user is to use privacy:

                   3)  generate the keyChange value based on the secret
                       privKey of the clone-from user and the secret key
                       to be used for the new user. Let us call this
                       pkcValue.
                   4)  GET(usmUserSpinLock.0) and save in sValue.
                   5)  SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue,
                           usmUserPrivKeyChange=pkcValue
                           usmUserPublic=randomValue1)
                   6)  GET(usmUserPulic) and check it has randomValue1.
                       If not, repeat steps 4-6.

                 If the new user will never use privacy:

                   7)  SET(usmUserPrivProtocol=usmNoPrivProtocol)

                 If the new user is to use authentication:

                   8)  generate the keyChange value based on the secret
                       authKey of the clone-from user and the secret key
                       to be used for the new user. Let us call this
                       akcValue.
                   9)  GET(usmUserSpinLock.0) and save in sValue.
                   10) SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue,
                           usmUserAuthKeyChange=akcValue
                           usmUserPublic=randomValue2)
                   11) GET(usmUserPulic) and check it has randomValue2.
                       If not, repeat steps 9-11.

                 If the new user will never use authentication:

                   12) SET(usmUserAuthProtocol=usmNoAuthProtocol)

                 Finally, activate the new user:

                   13) SET(usmUserStatus=active)

                 The new user should now be available and ready to be
                 used for SNMPv3 communication. Note however that access
                 to MIB data must be provided via configuration of the
                 SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB.

                 The use of usmUserSpinlock is to avoid conflicts with
                 another SNMP command generator application which may
                 also be acting on the usmUserTable.

                 When a new user is created (i.e., a new conceptual
                 row is instantiated in this table), the privacy and
                 authentication parameters of the new user must be
                 cloned from its clone-from user. These parameters are:
                   - authentication protocol (usmUserAuthProtocol)
                   - privacy protocol (usmUserPrivProtocol)
                 They will be copied regardless of what the current
                 value is.

                 Cloning also causes the initial values of the secret
                 authentication key (authKey) and the secret encryption

                 key (privKey) of the new user to be set to the same
                 values as the corresponding secrets of the clone-from
                 user to allow the KeyChange process to occur as
                 required during user creation.

                 The first time an instance of this object is set by
                 a management operation (either at or after its
                 instantiation), the cloning process is invoked.
                 Subsequent writes are successful but invoke no

                 An instance of this object is created concurrently
                 with the creation of any other object instance for
                 the same user (i.e., as part of the processing of
                 the set operation which creates the first object
                 instance in the same conceptual row).

                 If an initial set operation (i.e. at row creation time)
                 tries to set a value for an unknown or unsupported
                 protocol, then a 'wrongValue' error must be returned.

                 The value will be overwritten/set when a set operation
                 is performed on the corresponding instance of

                 Once instantiated, the value of such an instance of
                 this object can only be changed via a set operation to
                 the value of the usmNoAuthProtocol.

                 If a set operation tries to change the value of an

                 existing instance of this object to any value other
                 than usmNoAuthProtocol, then an 'inconsistentValue'

                 That means that an SNMP command generator application

  DESCRIPTION	"An object, which when modified, causes the secret
                 authentication key used for messages sent on behalf
                 of this user to/from the SNMP engine identified by
                 usmUserEngineID, to be modified via a one-way
                 function.

                 The associated protocol is the usmUserAuthProtocol.
                 The associated secret key is the user's secret
                 authentication key (authKey). The associated hash
                 algorithm is the algorithm used by the user's
                 usmUserAuthProtocol.

                 When creating a new user, it is an 'inconsistentName'
                 error for a set operation to refer to this object
                 unless it is previously or concurrently initialized
                 through a set operation on the corresponding instance
                 of usmUserCloneFrom.

                 When the value of the corresponding usmUserAuthProtocol
                 is usmNoAuthProtocol, then a set is successful, but
                 effectively is a no-op.

                 When this object is read, the zero-length (empty)
                 string is returned.

                 The recommended way to do a key change is as follows:

                   1) GET(usmUserSpinLock.0) and save in sValue.
                   2) generate the keyChange value based on the old
                      (existing) secret key and the new secret key,
                      let us call this kcValue.

                 If you do the key change on behalf of another user:

                   3) SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue,
                          usmUserAuthKeyChange=kcValue
                          usmUserPublic=randomValue)

                 If you do the key change for yourself:

                   4) SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue,
                          usmUserOwnAuthKeyChange=kcValue
                          usmUserPublic=randomValue)

                 If you get a response with error-status of noError,
                 then the SET succeeded and the new key is active.
                 If you do not get a response, then you can issue a
                 GET(usmUserPublic) and check if the value is equal
                 to the randomValue you did send in the SET. If so, then
                 the key change succeeded and the new key is active
                 (probably the response got lost). If not, then the SET
                 request probably never reached the target and so you
                 can start over with the procedure above.

  DESCRIPTION	"The table of locally available contexts.

                 This table provides information to SNMP Command

                 Generator applications so that they can properly
                 configure the vacmAccessTable to control access to
                 all contexts at the SNMP entity.

                 This table may change dynamically if the SNMP entity
                 allows that contexts are added/deleted dynamically
                 (for instance when its configuration changes).  Such
                 changes would happen only if the management
                 instrumentation at that SNMP entity recognizes more
                 (or fewer) contexts.

                 The presence of entries in this table and of entries
                 in the vacmAccessTable are independent.  That is, a
                 context identified by an entry in this table is not
                 necessarily referenced by any entries in the
                 vacmAccessTable; and the context(s) referenced by an
                 entry in the vacmAccessTable does not necessarily
                 currently exist and thus need not be identified by an
                 entry in this table.

                 This table must be made accessible via the default
                 context so that Command Responder applications have
                 a standard way of retrieving the information.

                 This table is read-only.  It cannot be configured via
                 SNMP.

  DESCRIPTION	"The table of access rights for groups.

                 Each entry is indexed by a groupName, a contextPrefix,
                 a securityModel and a securityLevel.  To determine
                 whether access is allowed, one entry from this table
                 needs to be selected and the proper viewName from that
                 entry must be used for access control checking.

                 To select the proper entry, follow these steps:

                 1) the set of possible matches is formed by the
                    intersection of the following sets of entries:

                      the set of entries with identical vacmGroupName
                      the union of these two sets:
                       - the set with identical vacmAccessContextPrefix
                       - the set of entries with vacmAccessContextMatch
                         value of 'prefix' and matching
                         vacmAccessContextPrefix
                      intersected with the union of these two sets:
                       - the set of entries with identical
                         vacmSecurityModel
                       - the set of entries with vacmSecurityModel
                         value of 'any'
                      intersected with the set of entries with
                      vacmAccessSecurityLevel value less than or equal
                      to the requested securityLevel

                 2) if this set has only one member, we're done
                    otherwise, it comes down to deciding how to weight
                    the preferences between ContextPrefixes,
                    SecurityModels, and SecurityLevels as follows:
                    a) if the subset of entries with securityModel
                       matching the securityModel in the message is
                       not empty, then discard the rest.
                    b) if the subset of entries with
                       vacmAccessContextPrefix matching the contextName
                       in the message is not empty,
                       then discard the rest
                    c) discard all entries with ContextPrefixes shorter
                       than the longest one remaining in the set
                    d) select the entry with the highest securityLevel

                 Please note that for securityLevel noAuthNoPriv, all
                 groups are really equivalent since the assumption that
                 the securityName has been authenticated does not hold.

                 use of the Set operation in creating or modifying
                 views.

                 When creating a new view or altering an existing
                 view, it is important to understand the potential
                 interactions with other uses of the view.  The
                 vacmViewSpinLock should be retrieved.  The name of
                 the view to be created should be determined to be
                 unique by the SNMP Command Generator application by
                 consulting the vacmViewTreeFamilyTable.  Finally,
                 the named view may be created (Set), including the
                 advisory lock.
                 If another SNMP Command Generator application has
                 altered the views in the meantime, then the spin
                 lock's value will have changed, and so this creation
                 will fail because it will specify the wrong value for
                 the spin lock.

                 Since this is an advisory lock, the use of this lock
                 is not enforced.

SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB::vacmViewTreeFamilyTable
vacmViewTreeFamilyTable OBJECT-TYPE
  -- FROM	SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB
  MAX-ACCESS	not-accessible
  STATUS	current
  DESCRIPTION	"Locally held information about families of subtrees
                 within MIB views.

                 Each MIB view is defined by two sets of view subtrees:
                   - the included view subtrees, and
                   - the excluded view subtrees.
                 Every such view subtree, both the included and the

                 excluded ones, is defined in this table.

                 To determine if a particular object instance is in
                 a particular MIB view, compare the object instance's
                 OBJECT IDENTIFIER with each of the MIB view's active
                 entries in this table.  If none match, then the
                 object instance is not in the MIB view.  If one or
                 more match, then the object instance is included in,
                 or excluded from, the MIB view according to the
                 value of vacmViewTreeFamilyType in the entry whose
                 value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree has the most
                 sub-identifiers.  If multiple entries match and have
                 the same number of sub-identifiers (when wildcarding
                 is specified with the value of vacmViewTreeFamilyMask),
                 then the lexicographically greatest instance of
                 vacmViewTreeFamilyType determines the inclusion or
                 exclusion.

                 An object instance's OBJECT IDENTIFIER X matches an
                 active entry in this table when the number of
                 sub-identifiers in X is at least as many as in the
                 value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree for the entry,
                 and each sub-identifier in the value of
                 vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree matches its corresponding
                 sub-identifier in X.  Two sub-identifiers match
                 either if the corresponding bit of the value of
                 vacmViewTreeFamilyMask for the entry is zero (the
                 'wild card' value), or if they are equal.

                 A 'family' of subtrees is the set of subtrees defined
                 by a particular combination of values of
                 vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask.

                 In the case where no 'wild card' is defined in the
                 vacmViewTreeFamilyMask, the family of subtrees reduces
                 to a single subtree.

                 When creating or changing MIB views, an SNMP Command
                 Generator application should utilize the
                 vacmViewSpinLock to try to avoid collisions.  See
                 DESCRIPTION clause of vacmViewSpinLock.

                 When creating MIB views, it is strongly advised that
                 first the 'excluded' vacmViewTreeFamilyEntries are
                 created and then the 'included' entries.

                 When deleting MIB views, it is strongly advised that
                 first the 'included' vacmViewTreeFamilyEntries are

                 deleted and then the 'excluded' entries.

                 If a create for an entry for instance-level access
                 control is received and the implementation does not
                 support instance-level granularity, then an
                 inconsistentName error must be returned.

  DESCRIPTION	"Information on a particular family of view subtrees

  DESCRIPTION	"The bit mask which, in combination with the
                 corresponding instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree,
                 defines a family of view subtrees.

                 Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a
                 sub-identifier of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree, with the
                 most significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet
                 string value (extended if necessary, see below)
                 corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-th sub-identifier, and
                 the least significant bit of the i-th octet of this
                 octet string corresponding to the (8*i)-th
                 sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through 16.

                 Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not
                 the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when
                 determining if an OBJECT IDENTIFIER is in this
                 family of view subtrees; a '1' indicates that an
                 exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild card',
                 i.e., any sub-identifier value matches.

                 Thus, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER X of an object instance
                 is contained in a family of view subtrees if, for
                 each sub-identifier of the value of
                 vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree, either:

                   the i-th bit of vacmViewTreeFamilyMask is 0, or

                   the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to the i-th
                   sub-identifier of the value of
                   vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree.

                 If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and

                 there are more than M sub-identifiers in the
                 corresponding instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree,
                 then the bit mask is extended with 1's to be the
                 required length.

                 Note that when the value of this object is the
                 zero-length string, this extension rule results in
                 a mask of all-1's being used (i.e., no 'wild card'),
                 and the family of view subtrees is the one view
                 subtree uniquely identified by the corresponding
                 instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree.

                 Note that masks of length greater than zero length
                 do not need to be supported.  In this case this
                 object is made read-only.

  STATUS	current
  DESCRIPTION	"The mask value associated with an entry in the
         snmpTargetAddrTable.  The value of this object must
         have the same length as the corresponding instance of
         snmpTargetAddrTAddress, or must have length 0.  An
         attempt to set it to any other value will result in
         an inconsistentValue error.

         The value of this object allows an entry in the
         snmpTargetAddrTable to specify multiple addresses.
         The mask value is used to select which bits of
         a transport address must match bits of the corresponding
         instance of snmpTargetAddrTAddress, in order for the
         transport address to match a particular entry in the
         snmpTargetAddrTable.  Bits which are 1 in the mask
         value indicate bits in the transport address which
         must match bits in the snmpTargetAddrTAddress value.

         Bits which are 0 in the mask indicate bits in the
         transport address which need not match.  If the
         length of the mask is 0, the mask should be treated
         as if all its bits were 1 and its length were equal
         to the length of the corresponding value of
         snmpTargetAddrTable.

         This object may not be modified while the value of the
         corresponding instance of snmpTargetAddrRowStatus is
         active(1).  An attempt to set this object in this case
         will result in an inconsistentValue error."
